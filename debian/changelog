    - Non lower-case rel attribute values are now processed
    - Favicons larger than 40KB can now be downloaded

    - Exact URL (page) now queried for favicon rather than domain root
    - Entry's modification date is now updated (no new history entry is created though; backups before mass favicon downloading is still recommended)

keepass2-plugin-favicondownloader (1.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

keepass2-plugin-favicondownloader (1.4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * It will hopefully work correctly on .NET 2.0 now.

keepass2-plugin-favicondownloader (1.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * If the webservice fails or returns a "default/unknown" icon then we now try grabbing it directly from the target website. It will only work if the icon is in the traditional location (/favicon.ico).
    Only the last error message is displayed now (a future improvement might be to log all errors somewhere but for now, this at least avoids having to click through hundreds of error messages if the favicon webservice is unavailable during bulk favicon downloads).
